## üì¢ FIRST POST AFTER UPDATE

Copy and paste this as your first post after updating:

```
After 10 years at Humana, I've learned something crucial:

The best innovations happen when you solve your own problems.

That's why I built Mirador - an AI system that orchestrates 58+ specialized LLMs.

Not because it was assigned. Because I needed it.

The result? Sub-second routing, 100% local processing, and a tool I use every day.

Sometimes the side project becomes the main story.
