# Email Configuration Guide for AI Talent Optimizer

## Current Status
❌ **Gmail authentication failing** - App password needs to be regenerated

## Quick Fix Instructions

### Step 1: Enable 2-Factor Authentication (if not already enabled)
1. Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/security
2. Click on **"2-Step Verification"**
3. Follow the setup process (use your phone for verification)
4. Once enabled, you'll see a green checkmark

### Step 2: Generate New App Password
1. Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. In the dropdown, select **"Mail"**
4. For device, select **"Other (Custom name)"**
5. Type: **"AI Talent Optimizer"**
6. Click **"Generate"**
7. You'll see a 16-character password like: `abcd efgh ijkl mnop`
8. **COPY THIS PASSWORD** (ignore the spaces)

### Step 3: Update Your Configuration
Edit the `.env` file:
```bash
# Open in your editor
nano /Users/matthewscott/AI-ML-Portfolio/ai-talent-optimizer/.env

# Or use VS Code
code /Users/matthewscott/AI-ML-Portfolio/ai-talent-optimizer/.env
```

Update this line with your new app password (no spaces):
```
EMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=abcdefghijklmnop
```

### Step 4: Test Configuration
```bash
cd /Users/matthewscott/AI-ML-Portfolio/ai-talent-optimizer
python test_email_config.py
```

You should see:
```
✅ SMTP Authentication successful!
✅ Test email sent to matthewdscott7@gmail.com
```

## Alternative: Use Outlook/Hotmail

If Gmail continues to have issues, you can use Outlook:

### Outlook Setup
1. Create/use Outlook account: https://outlook.com
2. Go to: https://account.microsoft.com/security
3. Enable 2-factor authentication
4. Go to **"Advanced security options"**
5. Under **"App passwords"**, create new one
6. Copy the password

Update `.env`:
```
EMAIL_ADDRESS=your_email@outlook.com
EMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=your_outlook_app_password
SMTP_SERVER=smtp-mail.outlook.com
SMTP_PORT=587
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **"Username and Password not accepted"**
   - You're using your regular Gmail password instead of app password
   - Solution: Generate app password as shown above

2. **"Please log in via your web browser"**
   - Gmail detected unusual activity
   - Solution: Log into Gmail web, check security alerts, try again

3. **"Connection timed out"**
   - Network/firewall issue
   - Solution: Check internet, try different network, check firewall

4. **App passwords option not visible**
   - 2-factor authentication not enabled
   - Solution: Enable 2FA first, then app passwords will appear

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit `.env` to git** (already in .gitignore)
2. **Use app passwords, not your main password**
3. **Rotate app passwords periodically**
4. **Monitor sent folder for unauthorized use**
5. **Set reasonable daily limits** (currently 20/day)

## Testing Your Setup

After configuration, test the full pipeline:

```bash
# 1. Test email connection
python test_email_config.py

# 2. Load latest jobs (307+ from real companies)
python load_real_company_jobs.py

# 3. Send test application (will send to real companies!)
python automated_apply.py

# 4. Check status
python main.py status
```
