## ðŸ“§ MESSAGE 1: Will Dolatowski (Tempus AI)

**Subject**: Provider Portal Architecture at Tempus

Hi Will,

I've been following your work on Tempus's provider-facing portal redesign and your shift to event-driven architecture - impressive scale challenges you're solving. 

With 10 years at Humana building AI systems for healthcare risk assessment (delivering $1.2M in annual savings), I deeply understand the complexity of provider workflows and compliance requirements. Your digital pathology viewer particularly caught my attention as we faced similar visualization challenges with clinical data at Humana.

Given Tempus's strong Q2 results and expansion, I'd love to learn more about how your engineering team is tackling provider adoption challenges. Would you be open to a brief conversation about the technical direction at Tempus?

Best,
Matthew Scott

## ðŸ“§ MESSAGE 2: For Notable Health Contact

**Subject**: Automating Healthcare's $1 Trillion Admin Problem

Hi [Name],

Notable's mission to eliminate healthcare's administrative burden resonates deeply with me. At Humana, I've seen firsthand how manual processes drain provider time - which is why I built AI automation systems that saved $1.2M annually while maintaining 100% CMS compliance.

Your work automating intake, documentation, and billing workflows aligns perfectly with my experience. I've spent 10 years navigating the intersection of healthcare compliance and AI efficiency - a balance I know Notable values.

With your deployment at 1,000+ locations, I imagine you're facing interesting scale challenges. I'd love to discuss how my experience with enterprise healthcare systems could contribute to Notable's growth.

Could we connect for a brief conversation?

Best regards,
Matthew
