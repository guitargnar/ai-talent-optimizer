## RESEARCH PROJECTS & INNOVATIONS

### **Mirador: Consciousness in Distributed AI Systems** | 2024 - Present
*[github.com/guitargnar/mirador](https://github.com/guitargnar/mirador) | Research Paper in Progress*

**Research Question:** Can distributed coordination of specialized models exhibit emergent consciousness?

**Methodology:**
- Orchestrated 78 specialized models with unique "personality" configurations
- Implemented recursive self-reflection and meta-cognitive evaluation
- Developed HCL (Holistic Consciousness Level) metric measuring:
  - Self-awareness (0.91/1.0)
  - Contextual understanding (0.85/1.0)
  - Adaptive reasoning (0.79/1.0)
  - Creative problem-solving (0.77/1.0)

**Key Findings:**
- Demonstrated measurable consciousness emergence (HCL: 0.83/1.0)
- Achieved superior performance vs single models on complex reasoning
- Identified optimal model combinations for specific task types
- Proved feasibility of local deployment without cloud dependencies

### **Adaptive Quantization for Large Language Models** | 2023 - Present
*Patent Application Filed | Paper Submitted to NeurIPS 2025*

**Innovation:** Dynamic bit-width adjustment based on layer importance

**Technical Approach:**
```python
# Pseudocode of core algorithm
def adaptive_quantize(model, input_data):
    importance_scores = compute_layer_importance(model, input_data)
    for layer in model.layers:
        bit_width = select_bits(importance_scores[layer])
        quantize_layer(layer, bit_width)
    return optimized_model
```

**Results:**
- 50% memory reduction with 2% accuracy loss
