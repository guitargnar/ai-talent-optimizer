I am writing to express my strong interest in the Junior Software Engineer position at mthree. Your comprehensive training program and focus on developing new graduates aligns perfectly with my career goals and technical background.

As a software engineer with 10+ years of Python experience, I bring:

‚Ä¢ Extensive experience building production systems, including a 274-module AI platform
‚Ä¢ Strong foundation in software development processes, source control, and agile methodologies
‚Ä¢ Proven ability to work in global team environments
‚Ä¢ Active open source contributor with a portfolio on GitHub (github.com/guitargnar)
‚Ä¢ Healthcare technology experience from 10 years at Humana

What particularly excites me about mthree is your 4-8 week training academy and commitment to continuous learning. Having invested heavily in my own development (including $250/month for Claude Code), I deeply value organizations that prioritize skill growth and mentorship.

My recent work includes building an AI Talent Optimizer platform that demonstrates my ability to create sophisticated automation systems while maintaining code quality and safety standards. This aligns well with your focus on building complex applications in team environments.

I am eager to bring my technical skills and passion for continuous improvement to the mthree team. The opportunity to work with other motivated graduates while contributing to meaningful projects is exactly what I'm seeking in my next role.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing how I can contribute to mthree's success.

Best regards,
Matthew Scott
