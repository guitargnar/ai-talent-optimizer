SUBJECT: Applied AI at Humana - excited about Tempus
PERSONALIZATION: 100%
==================================================

Hi Hiring Team,

Your recent Series C funding announcement caught my attention - we implemented something remarkably similar at Humana that saved $1.2M annually.

Beyond Humana, I've built passion projects like FretForge (guitar learning platform) and a phishing detector achieving 95% accuracy. This shows the creativity and initiative I'd bring to Tempus.

My unique value to Tempus:
• Technical depth (117 Python modules in production)
• Domain expertise (10 years healthcare)
• Proven innovation within constraints

Attached is my resume with full details. I'm ready to bring 10 years of healthcare AI experience to Tempus.

Excited to connect,
Matthew
