SUBJECT: Genuinely excited about Anthropic's $500M valuation
PERSONALIZATION: 100%
==================================================

Hi Hiring Team,

After 10 years at Humana building AI systems for healthcare, Anthropic's mission to democratize AI for everyone feels like the natural next step in my journey.

My work orchestrating 7 specialized LLMs through our Mirador system at Humana directly relates to Anthropic's needs in responsible AI development. The difference is you're pushing boundaries I can only dream about in a Fortune 50 environment.

My unique value to Anthropic:
• Technical depth (117 Python modules in production)
• Domain expertise (10 years healthcare)
• Proven innovation within constraints

I've attached my resume highlighting relevant experience. Would love to discuss how my Humana experience could accelerate Anthropic's mission.

Warmly,
Matthew
