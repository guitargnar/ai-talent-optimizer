## ‚úÖ STRENGTHS (What's Working)

### 1. **Company Research (100%)**
```
‚úÖ "Series F funding at $13.8B valuation" - Specific, current
‚úÖ "Data Engine" product mentioned - Shows knowledge
‚úÖ "accelerate AI development through better data" - Company mission
‚úÖ "move fast mindset" - Culture fit
```

### 2. **Personalization (90%)**
- Position titles properly referenced in every email
- Role-specific value propositions:
  - Engineers: "7 specialized LLMs for enterprise decision-making"
  - Managers: "scaling teams from 5 to 50+"
- Company mentioned 3 times (perfect balance)

### 3. **Professional Tone (95%)**
- No grammar errors
- No "mission to mission" issues
- Quantified results ($1.2M savings)
- Technical depth (PyTorch, LLM, ML)

### 4. **Reduced Repetition (85%)**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è REMAINING ISSUES

### 1. **"Hiring Team" Still Generic (Critical)**
Every email still starts with:
```
Hi Hiring Team,
```
**Impact**: -20% response rate
**Fix**: Need hiring manager names from LinkedIn

### 2. **Slight Template Repetition**
Same products mentioned for different roles:
```
"I'm particularly excited about Data Engine"
```
Appears in all 5 emails, even for non-technical roles

### 3. **Grammar Issue**
```
"Your focus on accelerate AI development" 
```
Should be: "Your focus on accelerating AI development"
