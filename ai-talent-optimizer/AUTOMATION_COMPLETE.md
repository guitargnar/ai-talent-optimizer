# ðŸš€ AI Job Hunter Automation - Complete Setup Guide

## What Has Been Automated

### 1. **Job Discovery** (Automated)
- Searches 6+ sources for AI/ML jobs every day at 9am and 6pm
- Discovers 25-50 new opportunities per run
- Filters by relevance score and salary
- Saves to unified database

### 2. **Email Tracking** (Automated)
- **BCC Tracking**: All sent applications are automatically tracked
- **Gmail Monitoring**: Responses from 15 target companies monitored
- **Follow-up Scheduling**: Automatic reminders at 3, 7, and 14 days

### 3. **Application Submission** (Semi-Automated)
- Generates personalized cover letters
- Tracks all applications in database
- Rate-limited to prevent spam
- BCC tracking for all sent emails

### 4. **Response Monitoring** (Automated)
- Checks Gmail every 30 minutes
- Categorizes responses (interview, rejection, etc.)
- Alerts for urgent actions

### 5. **Daily Reporting** (Automated)
- Morning and evening summaries
- Performance metrics
- Top opportunities list
- Action items

## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Manual full run
./run_now.sh

# Run job discovery only
python unified_ai_hunter.py --daily

# Send applications (batch of 5)
python automated_apply.py --batch 5

# Check email responses
python gmail_recent_monitor.py

# Generate report
python run_automation.py --report

# View database stats
sqlite3 -column -header UNIFIED_AI_JOBS.db "SELECT COUNT(*) as total, COUNT(CASE WHEN applied=1 THEN 1 END) as applied FROM job_discoveries"
```

## ðŸ“… Scheduled Automation

The system runs automatically:
- **9:00 AM**: Morning discovery + applications
- **6:00 PM**: Evening discovery + applications
- **Every 30 min**: Email response checking

### Managing the Schedule

```bash
# Start morning job manually
launchctl start com.matthewscott.aijobhunter.morning

# Stop automation
launchctl stop com.matthewscott.aijobhunter.morning

# View logs
tail -f logs/morning_run.log
```

## ðŸ“Š Current Status

```bash
# Check what's in the database
sqlite3 UNIFIED_AI_JOBS.db "SELECT company, position, salary_range FROM job_discoveries WHERE applied=0 ORDER BY relevance_score DESC LIMIT 5"

# See today's activity
cat daily_summaries/summary_$(date +%Y%m%d).json | jq .
```

## ðŸ”§ Configuration Files

### Key Files to Edit:
1. **`.env`** - Email credentials and API keys
2. **`unified_config.json`** - Job preferences and targets
3. **`email_config.json`** - Email settings and BCC addresses

### Important Paths:

# Check API credentials
cat .env | grep ADZUNA
```

### If emails aren't sending:
