## üìß LINKEDIN MESSAGE TO WILL DOLATOWSKI

**Subject**: Event-Driven Architecture for Healthcare AI at Scale

Hi Will,

I've been following your work on Tempus's provider portal redesign and the shift to event-driven architecture - impressive how you're handling the scale challenges while maintaining healthcare compliance.

Your digital pathology viewer particularly resonates with me. At Humana, I've spent 10 years building AI systems for risk assessment that process similar visual/clinical data, delivering $1.2M in annual savings while maintaining 100% CMS compliance. The balance between innovation and regulatory requirements in healthcare is a challenge I genuinely enjoy solving.

I noticed you're working on Tempus One's EHR integration. I recently built Mirador, a local LLM orchestration system that handles similar integration challenges - routing queries to specialized models based on context while maintaining HIPAA compliance.

With Tempus's impressive Q2 results and expansion, I imagine you're scaling the engineering team. I'd love to learn more about how you're tackling provider adoption challenges and discuss how my experience building enterprise healthcare AI could contribute.

Would you be open to a brief conversation? I'll be following your ASCO 2025 updates with interest.

Best regards,

## üìß LINKEDIN MESSAGE TO DAVID FUGATE

**Subject**: Building Developer Tools for Healthcare AI Teams

Hi David,

I came across your work leading the developer tools team at Tempus and was intrigued by your focus on in-house solutions. Your background - from Microsoft to Sandia Labs to now healthcare AI - shows a fascinating progression toward high-impact engineering.

At Humana, I've spent the last decade building internal tools that empower our teams to work with healthcare data safely and efficiently. Recently, I created Mirador, an LLM orchestration platform that lets our developers run 7+ AI models locally without cloud dependencies - saving $500+/month while maintaining HIPAA compliance.

Your awards for IronPython contributions and JavaScript standardization suggest you appreciate elegant solutions to complex problems. That's exactly what healthcare AI needs - tools that make the complex simple while preserving the rigor required for patient care.

I'd love to learn how your team approaches developer productivity in the context of precision medicine. Are you open to a brief conversation about the unique challenges of building tools for healthcare AI?

Looking forward to connecting,  
Matthew Scott

## üìù COVER LETTER

Dear Tempus AI Hiring Team,

When Eric Lefkofsky founded Tempus after his wife's cancer diagnosis, he understood that healthcare needs more than technology - it needs technology with purpose. My 10 years at Humana taught me the same lesson, as I built AI systems that didn't just process data, but improved real patient outcomes while navigating the complexity of healthcare compliance.

**Why I'm Interested in Tempus**

Your event-driven architecture for the provider portal, as described by Will Dolatowski, addresses the exact scalability challenges I've solved at Humana. While maintaining my day job, I built a platform with 117 Python modules processing 1M+ healthcare decisions daily - achieving 100% CMS compliance while delivering $1.2M in annual savings. This isn't theoretical; it's production code affecting real patients.

**What I Bring to Tempus**

My unique value lies in the intersection of three critical areas:

1. **Healthcare Domain Expertise**: A decade at a Fortune 50 insurer taught me how providers think, how regulations constrain innovation, and how to build systems that clinicians actually use.

2. **AI Implementation at Scale**: My Mirador platform orchestrates 7 different LLMs locally, routing queries intelligently while maintaining HIPAA compliance - similar to your Tempus One EHR integration challenges.

3. **Proven Business Impact**: Every system I build ties to measurable outcomes. The $1.2M savings wasn't just cost reduction - it improved Medicare Stars ratings by 8%, worth $50M to Humana.

**Technical Alignment**

Your digital pathology viewer particularly excites me. At Humana, I've worked with similar visual/clinical data fusion challenges, building systems that help clinicians make sense of complex multimodal information. I understand the delicate balance between model accuracy and interpretability that healthcare demands.

I'm drawn to Tempus because you're solving the right problems. Precision medicine isn't about having the best algorithms - it's about making those algorithms useful in clinical workflows. That's what I've done at Humana, and what I want to continue doing at Tempus.

I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience building enterprise healthcare AI systems could contribute to Tempus's mission of making precision medicine a reality.

Sincerely,  
Matthew Scott
