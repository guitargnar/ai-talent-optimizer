## üìù CUSTOM PITCH FOR TEMPUS

### Email/LinkedIn Message to Will Dolatowski

```
Subject: Event-Driven Architecture for Healthcare AI at Scale

Hi Will,

I've been following your work on Tempus's provider portal redesign and the shift to event-driven architecture - impressive how you're handling the scale challenges while maintaining healthcare compliance.

Your digital pathology viewer particularly resonates with me. At Humana, I've spent 10 years building AI systems for risk assessment that process similar visual/clinical data, delivering $1.2M in annual savings while maintaining 100% CMS compliance. The balance between innovation and regulatory requirements in healthcare is a challenge I genuinely enjoy solving.

I noticed you're working on Tempus One's EHR integration. I recently built Mirador, a local LLM orchestration system that handles similar integration challenges - routing queries to specialized models based on context while maintaining HIPAA compliance.

With Tempus's impressive Q2 results and expansion, I imagine you're scaling the engineering team. I'd love to learn more about how you're tackling provider adoption challenges and discuss how my experience building enterprise healthcare AI could contribute.

Would you be open to a brief conversation? I'll be following your ASCO 2025 updates with interest.

Best regards,
Matthew Scott

### Cover Letter Key Points

**Opening Hook**:

**Value Proposition**:
"I bring a rare combination: deep healthcare domain expertise from a Fortune 50 insurer, proven AI implementation skills (delivering $1.2M in savings), and the ability to navigate complex regulatory requirements while innovating."

**Specific Interest**:
"Your event-driven architecture for the provider portal addresses the exact scalability challenges I've solved at Humana. I'm particularly interested in how Tempus One integrates with EHR systems - a problem I've tackled with my Mirador platform."

**Closing**:
"I want to contribute to Tempus's mission of making precision medicine a reality. My experience shows I can deliver both technical excellence and business impact in healthcare AI."
