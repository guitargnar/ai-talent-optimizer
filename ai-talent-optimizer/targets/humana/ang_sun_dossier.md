## Public Statements & Philosophy

### On Augmented Intelligence (Key Quotes)
> "As Humana works to deliver human care, augmented intelligence is an important part of our strategy. Augmented intelligence can help us make the next appropriate action from a digital perspective, and as a result, help us build trust with our members and patients."

> "When we advance equity and fairness in AI, we help members achieve their best health. AI helps us identify appropriate interventions that have the potential to significantly improve people's lives."

### Key Principles He Champions
1. **Human-in-the-Loop**: Maintains that clinicians must retain ultimate decision-making authority
2. **Trust Building**: Sees AI as a tool to build member trust, not replace human judgment
3. **Equity & Fairness**: Emphasizes reducing bias and discrimination in AI systems
4. **Transparency**: Advocates for explainable AI in healthcare decisions

## Current Crisis Context (NEVER mention directly in outreach)

### The nH Predict Lawsuit
- **Filed**: December 2023
- **Allegation**: Humana uses AI (nH Predict) to systematically deny post-acute care to elderly Medicare Advantage patients
- **Impact**: Class-action status, Senate investigation, massive reputational damage
- **Key Issue**: AI overriding physician judgment to cut costs
- **Statistics**: Denial rates increased from 8.7% to 22.7% (2019-2022)

### Humana's Official Response
- Emphasizes "augmented intelligence" with human oversight
- Claims all coverage decisions involve clinical judgment
- Filed for dismissal (March 2024) on jurisdictional grounds

### The Strategic Tension
Ang Sun must reconcile:
- **Public Position**: "Ethical, human-centered AI"
- **Operational Reality**: Facing lawsuits for AI denying care
- **Business Pressure**: Need for cost savings and efficiency
- **Regulatory Scrutiny**: Senate investigation, CMS watching closely
