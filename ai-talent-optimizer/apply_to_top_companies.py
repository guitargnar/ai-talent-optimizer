I am writing to express my strong interest in the {job['position']} position. With my proven track record of building production ML systems that have generated over $1.2M in value, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to {job['company']}'s mission.

{company_paragraph}

My recent technical accomplishments include:

‚Ä¢ **Job Intelligence Platform**: Built an end-to-end ML platform with TensorFlow 2.20, achieving 92% salary prediction accuracy using advanced NLP and clustering algorithms processing 1000+ jobs daily.

‚Ä¢ **Mirador AI Platform**: Architected a 79+ model orchestration system achieving 99.3% success rate, implementing RAG pipelines, vector databases, and multi-modal AI capabilities serving 250K+ requests monthly.

‚Ä¢ **Enterprise Impact**: During my 10 years at Humana, I built ML systems that automated Medicare compliance workflows, saving $1.2M annually while maintaining 100% CMS adherence.

My technical expertise includes:
- Deep proficiency in TensorFlow, PyTorch, and modern ML frameworks
- Production deployment of LLMs, embeddings, and neural architectures
- Strong foundation in MLOps, distributed systems, and scalable infrastructure
- Proven ability to translate ML research into measurable business value

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience can contribute to {job['company']}'s continued success in the {job['position']} role.
