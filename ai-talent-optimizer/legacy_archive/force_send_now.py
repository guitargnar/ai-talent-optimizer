I am writing to express my strong interest in the {position} role at {company}.

With 10+ years at Fortune 50 Humana, I've architected AI systems that have:
‚Ä¢ Delivered $1.2M+ in annual cost savings through intelligent automation
‚Ä¢ Processed 1M+ healthcare records daily with 96% accuracy
‚Ä¢ Maintained zero critical defects across 1,000+ production deployments
‚Ä¢ Built an AI orchestration platform managing 89 specialized models

What makes me uniquely qualified for {company}:

Technical Excellence: I've personally built a platform with 117 Python modules and 86,000+ files while maintaining my demanding day job at Humana. This includes implementing cutting-edge models like Llama, Gemma, and Command-R in production environments.

Healthcare Domain Expertise: My decade at Humana has given me deep understanding of enterprise-scale challenges, compliance requirements, and the critical importance of reliable AI systems when human lives are involved.

Proven Impact: Beyond the $1.2M in savings at Humana, I've generated $174K in revenue through AI-powered automation side projects, demonstrating my ability to deliver business value.

I'm particularly excited about {company}'s mission and believe my combination of enterprise experience and hands-on technical skills would add immediate value to your team.

I've attached my resume highlighting 78 specialized ML models I've implemented and my extensive experience with TensorFlow, PyTorch, and modern MLOps practices.

I'm available for immediate discussion and can be reached at:
