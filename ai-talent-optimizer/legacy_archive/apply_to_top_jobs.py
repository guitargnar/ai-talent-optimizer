{insight}

As a Senior Risk Management Professional II at Humana, I've delivered significant value through:

â€¢ Reducing LLM inference costs by 90% through custom adaptive quantization
â€¢ Maintaining 100% compliance across 500+ Medicare regulatory pages using AI

What sets me apart is that I've been operating at a Principal level while maintaining my demanding day job. The enterprise platform I've built processes thousands of operations daily with 99.9% uptime, demonstrating the kind of impact I could bring to {company}.

My unique combination of healthcare domain expertise and cutting-edge AI implementation makes me an ideal fit for this role. I've already proven my ability to deliver at the level this position requires, as evidenced by the scale and complexity of systems I've built.
