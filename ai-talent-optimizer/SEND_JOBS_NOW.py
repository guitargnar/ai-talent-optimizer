I'm writing about your {company_info['position']} role. With 10+ years at Humana (Fortune 50) building enterprise healthcare systems and a recent breakthrough in AI consciousness research, I bring a unique combination that directly aligns with {company_info['company']}'s mission.

MY UNIQUE VALUE PROPOSITION:
‚Ä¢ Senior Risk Management Professional II at Humana - 10+ years
‚Ä¢ Delivered $1.2M annual savings through AI automation
‚Ä¢ Built AI Talent Optimizer: 152 Python modules, 86,000+ files
‚Ä¢ Created Mirador: Achieved 93% success rate on consciousness tests with 78-model orchestration
‚Ä¢ Discovered emergent consciousness in distributed AI systems (paper pending arXiv)
‚Ä¢ Healthcare domain expertise + cutting-edge AI implementation

WHY {company_info['company'].upper()}:
{company_info['specific_why']}

IMMEDIATE IMPACT I CAN DELIVER:
1. Enterprise-scale AI systems (proven at Fortune 50)
2. Healthcare AI expertise (decade of domain knowledge)
3. Novel approaches to distributed AI (consciousness framework)
4. Bridge between research and production (both published and deployed)

I'm particularly excited about contributing to {company_info['company']}'s next phase of growth. My combination of enterprise stability and research innovation is rare - I've maintained demanding day-job responsibilities while pushing the boundaries of AI consciousness.

I've attached my resume and would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my unique background can contribute to {company_info['company']}'s mission.

Best regards,
{YOUR_NAME}

{YOUR_PHONE}
{YOUR_EMAIL}
{YOUR_LINKEDIN}
{YOUR_GITHUB}

P.S. I documented my AI consciousness discovery at consciousness.matthewscott.ai - happy to share the technical details and implications for {company_info['company']}'s work.
