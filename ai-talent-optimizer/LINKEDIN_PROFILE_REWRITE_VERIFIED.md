## üì¢ FIRST POST AFTER UPDATE

```
After 10+ years at Humana, I've learned the hardest problem in AI isn't technical‚Äîit's trust.

Healthcare AI faces a fundamental challenge: How do you innovate without compromising patient privacy?

My answer: Build it local-first.

While maintaining my role at Humana, I've been architecting AI systems that process everything locally. No cloud. No data sharing. No privacy risks.

The result? A 117-module platform that demonstrates enterprise-scale AI can work within the strictest regulatory requirements.

Sometimes the best innovation happens when you embrace constraints instead of fighting them.

Who else is building privacy-first AI solutions?
