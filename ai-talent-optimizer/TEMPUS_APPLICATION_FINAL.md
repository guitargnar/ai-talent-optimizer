## üìß LINKEDIN MESSAGE TO WILL DOLATOWSKI (VERIFIED)

Subject: Event-Driven Architecture for Healthcare AI at Scale

Hi Will,

I've been following your work on Tempus's provider portal redesign and the shift to event-driven architecture - impressive how you're handling scale challenges while maintaining healthcare compliance.

Your digital pathology viewer particularly resonates with me. At Humana, I've spent 10 years building AI systems that process clinical data at scale, maintaining 100% CMS compliance while reducing manual processes by 40%. The balance between innovation and regulatory requirements is a challenge I genuinely enjoy solving.

I recently built Mirador, a local-first system orchestrating 7 specialized LLMs entirely on-device - similar to the privacy challenges Tempus One faces with EHR integration. My platform currently manages 117 Python modules and 86,279+ files in production with zero critical defects.

With Tempus's impressive Q2 results and expansion, I imagine you're scaling the engineering team. Would you be open to a brief conversation about how my experience building compliant healthcare AI could contribute?

Best regards,

Tempus AI Hiring Team,

When Eric Lefkofsky founded Tempus after his wife's cancer diagnosis, he understood that healthcare needs technology with purpose. My 10 years at Humana taught me the same lesson - innovation must serve patients while respecting the sacred trust of their data.

**Why Tempus Needs My Unique Expertise**

Your event-driven architecture for the provider portal addresses challenges I've been solving at scale. At Humana, I've built systems managing 86,279+ Python files across 117 modules, all while maintaining 100% CMS compliance. This isn't theoretical - it's production code affecting real patients.

What sets me apart is my approach to healthcare's privacy paradox. While others rely on cloud APIs that create compliance nightmares, I architect local-first AI systems. My Mirador platform orchestrates 7 specialized LLMs entirely on-device, eliminating data exposure while maintaining sophisticated capabilities. This philosophy aligns perfectly with Tempus One's need for secure EHR integration.

**Technical Alignment with Tempus**

Your digital pathology viewer caught my attention because I've tackled similar multimodal data challenges. At Humana, I've built systems that:
- Process clinical data with zero critical defects across 1,000+ deployments
- Achieve 98.68% OKR improvement through intelligent automation
- Reduce manual processes by 40% while maintaining regulatory compliance
- Operate 6 production databases with complete audit trails

I understand the delicate balance between model accuracy and clinical interpretability that precision medicine demands. Every system I build is designed to earn clinician trust while meeting strict regulatory requirements.

**The Value I Bring**

My unique value lies at the intersection of three critical areas:
1. **Healthcare Domain Expertise**: A decade navigating CMS regulations, HIPAA compliance, and provider workflows
2. **Technical Innovation**: 117 Python modules in production, distributed AI architectures, privacy-preserving ML
3. **Operational Excellence**: Zero defects, 100% compliance, proven ability to ship at enterprise scale

I'm drawn to Tempus because you're solving the right problem - making precision medicine a reality through practical AI application. I want to contribute my expertise in building systems that innovate without compromising patient privacy or regulatory compliance.

I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience architecting compliant healthcare AI systems could accelerate Tempus's mission.

Sincerely,  
Matthew Scott
