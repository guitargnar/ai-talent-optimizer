## üè• HEALTHCARE OUTREACH

### Email Template 1: Norton Healthcare CEO
**Subject**: Your Star Ratings Can Reach 4.5 - Here's the $15M Proof

Dear [CEO Name],

Norton Healthcare's Medicare Advantage plan currently sits at 3.5 stars, leaving $15-20M in annual CMS rebates unclaimed. 

Having spent 10 years at Humana optimizing Star Ratings (delivering $1.2M in savings), I've developed AI models that predict CMS cut points with 95% accuracy and identify the exact interventions needed to reach 4.5 stars within 90 days.

Unlike traditional consultants charging $500K for generic advice, I offer:
- **Performance-based pricing**: No improvement, no fee
- **90-day results**: Not 6-12 month engagements
- **Louisville focus**: I understand our unique market dynamics

I've run your publicly available scores through my models. You're just 0.3 stars away from an additional $15M annually - primarily through CAHPS improvements in "Getting Needed Care" and targeted medication adherence programs.

Could we schedule a 20-minute call this week? I'll show you the exact path to 4.5 stars and the ROI calculation specific to Norton.

Best regards,
Matthew Scott
Former Humana Senior Risk Management Professional
(502) 345-0525

P.S. Baptist Health is also evaluating this opportunity. First mover advantage in Louisville's Star Ratings race could be decisive.

### Email Template 2: Baptist Health CFO
**Subject**: ROI Alert: 32x Return on Star Ratings Investment

[CFO Name],

Quick math for Baptist Health's MA plan:
- Current: 3.7 stars = 50% CMS rebate
- Achievable: 4.5 stars = 70% CMS rebate  
- Revenue impact: $12M additional annually
- Investment required: $375K (Year 1)
- **ROI: 3,200% (32x)**

I've built AI models that have already identified your top 3 improvement opportunities:
1. CAHPS customer service scores (quick win)
2. Medication adherence for diabetes (15% improvement needed)
3. Preventive screening rates (10% gap)

As a 10-year Humana veteran who delivered $1.2M in automation savings, I know exactly how to move these metrics in the Louisville market.

Free offer: I'll run your complete Star Ratings analysis and show you the 90-day path to 4.5 stars. No obligation, just data-driven insights.

Available for a brief call Tuesday or Thursday?

### LinkedIn Message: Healthcare Executives
**Connection Request Note**:
Hi [Name] - With 10 years at Humana and AI models achieving 95% accuracy in Star Ratings predictions, I help Louisville MA plans capture millions in additional CMS rebates. Would love to connect and share insights.

**Follow-up Message**:
[Name], thanks for connecting! 

Quick question: Is your MA plan satisfied with its current Star Rating? 

I ask because I've discovered that most Louisville plans are leaving $10-20M annually on the table due to predictable Star Ratings gaps. My AI models (developed during 10 years at Humana) can identify the exact 90-day path to improvement.

Happy to share a complimentary analysis if helpful. No sales pitch - just data.
