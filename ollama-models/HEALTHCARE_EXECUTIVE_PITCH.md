## The $3 Billion Problem Facing Louisville Health Systems

### CMS Star Ratings Changes in 2025:
- **Cut point increases**: Up to 6 points for key CAHPS measures
- **Revenue impact**: 20% rebate difference between 3.5 and 4.5 stars
- **Local challenge**: Louisville systems average 3.7 stars (below national 4.1)

### For a 50,000 member MA plan:
- **Current state (3.5 stars)**: 50% rebate = $125M
- **Target state (4.5 stars)**: 70% rebate = $175M
- **Annual opportunity**: **$50M additional revenue**
