### Recommended Approach:
1. **LinkedIn First**: Connect with executives directly
2. **Media Relations**: For healthcare systems (they have dedicated teams)
3. **Alumni Network**: Use Humana connections for warm intros
4. **Partnership Route**: V-Soft/Centric more accessible than enterprises
5. **Microsoft Revival**: Approach Ben Reno-Weber about reviving AI hub

### Priority Targets (Based on Accessibility):
1. **V-Soft Consulting** - Direct phone, clear leadership
2. **Norton Healthcare** - Media team responsive
3. **Microsoft AI Hub** - Needs revival, opportunity
4. **GE Appliances** - Recent investment, momentum
5. **Humana** - Use alumni network

### Email Construction:
