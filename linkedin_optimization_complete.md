# LinkedIn Optimization Strategy for Matthew Scott
*Complete Signal Overhaul - From Risk Management to AI Innovation Leader*

## üéØ CORE POSITIONING PROBLEM

Your current LinkedIn positions you as a "Risk Management Professional" who happens to do AI on the side. This buried lead is killing your visibility. CEOs looking for AI talent will never find you.

**The Fix**: Reposition as an AI/ML Engineer who brings deep healthcare compliance expertise‚Äîa rare and valuable combination.

---

## üìä CURRENT PROFILE ANALYSIS

### What's Working:
- AWS ML Certification (recent, credible)
- Real GitHub projects (Reflexia, Ziggy)
- Solid follower count (1,053)
- About section shows progression narrative

### Critical Issues:
1. **Title Confusion**: "Senior Risk Management Professional ‚Üí AI Innovation Leader" screams uncertainty
2. **Buried Expertise**: Your AI/ML work is hidden under corporate risk management title
3. **No Clear CTA**: CEOs don't know you're available for fractional/consulting work
4. **Mightily Missing**: 5 years of agency experience completely absent
5. **Metrics Focus Wrong**: Leading with compliance metrics instead of innovation metrics

## üé≠ CONTENT STRATEGY

### First Post (Today):
```
After 10 years at Humana, I've learned something crucial:

The best innovations happen when you solve your own problems.

That's why I built Mirador - an AI system that orchestrates 58+ specialized LLMs.

Not because it was assigned. Because I needed it.

The result? Sub-second routing, 100% local processing, and a tool I use every day.

Sometimes the side project becomes the main story.

What problems are you solving outside your job description?

#AI #Innovation #HealthcareIT #BuildInPublic
```

### Weekly Themes:
- **Monday**: Technical deep dive (how you built X)
- **Wednesday**: Healthcare AI insights
- **Friday**: Lessons from side projects

---

## üéØ THE SHIV RAO OPTIMIZATION

When CEOs like Shiv click your profile, they need to see:

1. **First 3 words**: "AI/ML Engineer" not "Risk Management"
2. **First line of About**: "I build AI systems..." not "I'm not typical..."
3. **Clear availability**: Fractional CTO in headline or About
4. **Proof points**: GitHub, AWS cert, real systems
5. **Contact info**: Visible and easy

---

## üí° CRITICAL INSIGHTS

### Your Unique Positioning:
**"The Compliance-Fluent AI Engineer"**
- Most AI engineers can't navigate healthcare regulations
- Most compliance experts can't build AI systems
- You do both, in production, at scale

### The Mightily Connection:
Shows crucial progression:
- Digital marketing ‚Üí Data analysis ‚Üí Automation ‚Üí AI
- Proves you're not a "sudden AI expert" but have 12+ year journey

### Remove These Phrases:
- "I'm not your typical..."
- "Self-taught" (show it, don't say it)
- "Transformed from risk management" (just BE the AI engineer)

---

## üìà SUCCESS METRICS

Track these after changes:
1. Profile views (should 2-3x in first week)
2. Search appearances for "AI", "ML", "Healthcare AI"
3. InMail from recruiters/CEOs
4. Connection requests from AI professionals

---

## üö® BIGGEST MISTAKE TO AVOID

Don't position yourself as "learning AI" or "transitioning to AI". You ARE an AI engineer. You've built production systems. Own it.

Your LinkedIn should scream: "I solve expensive problems with AI, and I can prove it."

---

**Remember**: LinkedIn is not a resume. It's a billboard. Make every word sell your value to someone who has 3 seconds to decide if you're worth clicking.
