## Next Steps Timeline

### Day 1-2 (Aug 7-8): Monitor & Prepare

- [ ] Visit Shiv's profile daily (he'll see you viewing)
- [ ] Apply to ALL Abridge positions on their careers page
- [ ] Engage with Abridge's LinkedIn posts (like, thoughtful comments)

### Day 3 (Aug 10): Follow-Up if No Response
```
Hi Shiv,

Quick follow-up on my message about career opportunities at Abridge.

I've since applied to your Principal Engineer position and wanted to highlight that my healthcare automation experience (saved Humana $1.2M annually) aligns perfectly with Abridge's mission to eliminate administrative burden.

If you're not the right person for engineering roles, could you point me to your engineering leadership?

Best,
Matthew

P.S. The "goldmine of work" I mentioned includes a 58-model AI system that could be valuable for medical documentation.
```

### Day 7 (Aug 14): Final LinkedIn Attempt
```
Hi Shiv,

I know you're incredibly busy with the $550M round and scaling Abridge.

I'll make this brief: I can start immediately as Principal Engineer and bring 10 years of healthcare expertise that would normally take months to find.

If timing isn't right, I understand. I'll continue following Abridge's impressive journey.

Best wishes,
Matthew
```

### Day 8+: Alternative Channels
1. **Email directly**: shiv@abridge.com or srao@abridge.com
