## ðŸ”¥ SEND THESE NEXT (In Order of Priority)

### 1. Eric Lefkofsky - Tempus AI CEO
**LinkedIn**: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericlefkofsky/
**Send Time**: NOW
```
Hi Eric,

Impressive work taking Tempus public with that $8B valuation. Your precision medicine vision resonates deeply with my healthcare AI experience.

I've spent 10 years at Humana where I built a 58-model AI orchestration system that saved $1.2M annually. Currently exploring how I can bring similar innovation to companies transforming healthcare.

With Tempus's 59 open positions, I imagine you're scaling rapidly. Would you be open to discussing how my experience automating complex healthcare workflows could accelerate your AI initiatives?

Best,
Matthew Scott

### 2. Mario Schlosser - Oscar Health CEO  
**LinkedIn**: https://www.linkedin.com/in/marioschlosser/
**Send Time**: After Tempus (10 min gap)
```
Hi Mario,

Your InsurTech innovation at Oscar aligns perfectly with my recent work. I just finished analyzing the market using Claude Code and Oscar's approach to healthcare technology stands out.

At Humana, I delivered $1.2M in annual savings through AI automation while maintaining 100% CMS compliance - exactly the kind of impact Oscar needs as you scale your GenAI implementation.

I'm exploring Principal Engineering roles where I can apply my healthcare + AI expertise. Would you have 15 minutes to discuss Oscar's technical roadmap and how I might contribute?

Best,
Matthew
```

### 3. Tony Stubblebine - Medium CEO
**LinkedIn**: https://www.linkedin.com/in/tonystubblebine/  
**Send Time**: Afternoon (2-3 PM)
```
Hi Tony,

I've been following Medium's evolution and your VP Engineering role caught my attention - reporting directly to you is exactly the kind of high-impact position I'm seeking.

After 10 years at Humana delivering $1.2M in automation savings, I'm ready to bring that enterprise discipline to a more agile environment. I've been building with AI/ML for 3 years and see huge potential for content platforms.

Would you be interested in discussing how my blend of enterprise stability and startup innovation could help Medium's next chapter?

Best,
Matthew
```

### 4. Ankit Jain - Infinitus CEO
**LinkedIn**: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ankitjain/
**Send Time**: Tomorrow morning
```
Hi Ankit,

Your work automating healthcare calls at Infinitus is brilliant - exactly the kind of problem I've been solving at scale.

I've spent the last decade at Humana where I automated workflows that saved $1.2M annually. Now I'm offering fractional CTO services to healthcare AI startups.

With your recent growth, you might benefit from someone who's navigated enterprise healthcare complexity. Open to a quick call about accelerating Infinitus's technical roadmap?

2 days/week @ $15K/month - bringing Fortune 50 experience to your startup.

Best,
Matthew
```

### 5. Guy Benjamin - Healthee CEO
**LinkedIn**: https://www.linkedin.com/in/guybenjamin/
**Send Time**: Tomorrow afternoon
```
Hi Guy,

Healthee's $32M Series A is exciting news! Your AI-powered benefits navigation platform addresses pain points I've seen firsthand.

At Humana, I built systems serving 50M+ users while maintaining zero critical defects. Currently exploring fractional CTO opportunities with healthcare AI companies.

Would you be open to discussing how 2 days/week of Fortune 50 expertise could accelerate your platform development? I can bring both the technical depth and healthcare domain knowledge Healthee needs.

Best,
Matthew
